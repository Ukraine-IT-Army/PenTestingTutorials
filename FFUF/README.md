# FFUF 

---

## Introduction

FFUF (https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is a tool designed to enumerate websites, it should be your first step when attempting to hack websites. 
This tutorial will focus on the most basic usecase of this tool, enough to get you started, but you are encouraged to visit the official site and learn more (or use your OSINT tools and find some tutorials)

---

## How it works

FFUF does something that we all do everyday while browsing the internet, moving from URL to URL. you could manually do what FFUF and I encourage you to do so for a few minutes. The strength of FFUF is that it can browse through webpages in seconds instead of minutes or hours, and given the right wordlist (a wordlist is required to use FFUF, it tells the program what URLs it should try to find) it could find vulnerabilities in seconds.

## Usage

Let's get started. We will be using FFUF to scan website that might be given by the Ukraininan Government via the Telegram IT ARMY group (https://t.me/itarmyofukraine2022) or via other communication.


#### Download

The first thing you need to do is download the tool if you do not have it already, visit the link below and follow the instructions, they explian it better and more in-depth than I could here given the time restrictions.

https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf#installation

On top of downloading the application FFUF, you should also download the following wordlists, they are .txt files designed to help you hack

* https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
* https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
* https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt


#### First Use

Once you have downloaded the tool you're ready to start investigating and finding vulnerabilites to exploit, but how do you do that?

FFUF follows the linux / unix notation where you use the tool by writing its name on the terminal followed by whatever function you want to use from the tool itself. 

Example:
```bash
FFUF find_information_about_website
```
unfortunately FFUF is not so verbose, so we need to speak to it in a language it understands, the correct way to request FFUF to search a website would be the following. (make sure you are located in the same place you downloaded the wordlists or use the absolute path of the file)
```bash
ffuf -u https://example_page.com/FUZZ -w example_wordlist.txt
```
here the **-u** stands for URL, and **-w** stands for wordlist.
You should always put the keyword **FUZZ** at the end of the URL, FFUF then changes that word for each of the lines on the wordlist txt

#### Understanding Output

The output of FFUF should be self explanatory for the most part, but just in case, below is the explanation of an example of FFUF output

this is the command used
```bash
ffuf -u https://google.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
```
this is the output
```bash
        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/       

       v1.3.1-dev

```
It tells us a lot of extra information we don't need for this scenario, and at the bottom it shows the progress, and if it receives an answer from the server it will give us two things **URL** -> this is the link we should check on our web browser **Response Status** -> this tells us what the server is saying about the URL we requested, the most common Response status are below on the **Common response status** section. But generally *200* means that you should check more as it found a link, and *500,400, or 300* means that nothing was found.

## Good wordlists

## Common response status

Below are the most common response status (what a server will return when you try to browse a webpage) and their explanations

* Status Code 200 – This is the standard “OK” status code for a successful HTTP request. The response that is returned is dependent on the request. For example, for a GET request, the response will be included in the message body. For a PUT/POST request, the response will include the resource that contains the result of the action.
* Status Code 201 – This is the status code that confirms that the request was successful and, as a result, a new resource was created. Typically, this is the status code that is sent after a POST/PUT request.
* Status Code 204 – This status code confirms that the server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return information. Examples of this status code include delete requests or if a request was sent via a form and the response should not cause the form to be refreshed or for a new page to load.
* Status Code 304 – The is status code used for browser caching. If the response has not been modified, the client/user can continue to use the same response/cached version. For example, a browser can request if a resource has been modified since a specific time. If it hasn’t, the status code 304 is sent. If it has been modified, a status code 200 is sent, along with the resource.
* Status Code 400 – The server cannot understand and process a request due to a client error. Missing data, domain validation, and invalid formatting are some examples that cause the status code 400 to be sent.
* Status Code 401 – This status code request occurs when authentication is required but has failed or not been provided.
* Status Code 403 – Very similar to status code 401, a status code 403 happens when a valid request was sent, but the server refuses to accept it. This happens if a client/user requires the necessary permission or they may need an account to access the resource. Unlike a status code 401, authentication will not apply here.
* Status Code 404 – The most common status code the average user will see. A status code 404 occurs when the request is valid, but the resource cannot be found on the server. Even though these are grouped in the Client Errors “bucket,” they are often due to improper URL redirection.
* Status Code 409 – A status code 409 is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the resource. This is usually an issue with simultaneous updates, or versions, that conflict with one another.
* Status Code 410 – Resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. Learn about network error 410.
* Status Code 500 – Another one of the more commonly seen status codes by users, the 500 series codes are similar to the 400 series codes in that they are true error codes. The status code 500 happens when the server cannot fulfill a request due to an unexpected issue. Web developers typically have to comb through the server logs to determine where the exact issue is coming from.

## Common FFUF usage

the most basic usage is the following, where **example_website** should be changed to the website you wish to target, and **wordlist.txt** should be changed to the wordlist you wish to use (check the section on wordlists for the best wordlists to use)
```bash
ffuf -u https://example_website.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
```

If you want to be able to read the output easier, consider using **-c** it stands for color, and it highlights important things by changing their color
```bash
ffuf -c -u https://example_website.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
```
