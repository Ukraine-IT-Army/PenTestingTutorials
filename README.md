## Introduction

Most of the people reading this blog will have been supporting Ukraine by committing DDoS (Distributed Denial of Serrvice) attacks, these attacks consists of many computers or electronic devices requesting webpages or other online resources at the same time, overwhelming the servers that send this information and therefore taking them down. 

This guide is designed to take your support for Ukraine to the next level.

## The four steps of a successful attack

every great hack involves 4 stages, it is not necessary to always do them and it won't always be possible to but one should strive to do so.

### OSINT

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is the first step when engaging a target, it involves learning what the target does, in the case of a company or corporation the employees and trusted people.

OSINT does not have any specialized tools, or at least not any that would be especially useful in this situation (if that's not the case let me know so I can update this list) so for any target that you wish to engage google and other engines as well as pages like linkedin are your best bet.

TIP : In the current situation OSINT is likely not one of the top priorities so you can move past it if neccessary.

### Enumeration

Once you have chosen a target, and found out as much information about them as you possibly can, the next step is enumeration. Both the previous and current step involve finding out as much information about the target as possible. The big difference is Enumeration involves directly getting information from the target, for example this could involve trying to find a login page for an adim on a website, or open ports on a server. (Don't worry if you don't understand this, it will be explained further below).

There are some tools that can help with enumeration, they are listed below (The tutorials for these tools can be found on the folders above, each one has the name of the tool): 

### Execution

Once you have enumerated the target and found a vulnerability (or multiple) it is time for action!, Now at this section I must ask that you consider things carefully. Until now everything you have done is 100% legal, from now on everything you do is considered a felony, I urge you to continue regardless and do as much damage as you can. But you must know that there could be consequences.

I could write a hundred books on ways to execute attacks, but as a beginner you will likely only encounter and be able to exploit basic vulnerabilities or create brute force attacks.

Below are the most common website vulnerabilities (go to the folder titles OWASP for tutorials on all exploits):

Below are common Network Vulnerabilities (go to the folder titles Network Vulnerabilites for tutorials on exploits):


### Permanence

This step is the most advanced and it encompasses finding a way to remain inside the server or wherever the hack has taken place, why is this important you ask?. It allows you to enter a high privileged account or service again and again without having to re-hack the device, this lowers your profile and makes it significantly harder to track you. In this guide Permanence is only mentioned so you know it exists and it is an objective. There is not much of a reason to try to remain on an alrady compromised location with the type of attack you will be making.
